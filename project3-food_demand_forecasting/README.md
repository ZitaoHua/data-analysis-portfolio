 # Project 3: Food Demand Forecasting 
 ## Objective
 Develop a high-performance predictive model (XGBoost) to forecast weekly meal order quantities for a food delivery service, focusing on feature engineering to capture temporal, price, and meal-specific demand drivers.
 
- **Dataset:** [Food Delivery Service Orders](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kannanaikkal/food-demand-forecasting/data?select=train.csv)
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, XGBoost)
- **Skills:** Time-series analysis, feature engineering (lag features, mean encoding), model training, time-based validation
- 
## Key Questions
1\. How do meal characteristics (cuisine, category) and center logistics influence demand?
2\. What is the impact of price elasticity and discount strategies (base_price vs. checkout_price) on order volume?
3\. How can time-series features (e.g., historical lag, weekly trend) be engineered to improve forecasting accuracy?
4\. What is the optimal model architecture and feature set to minimize the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)?
5\. How does the model perform under time-based cross-validation?
